# Stocks-Analysis
  Performing the analysis on All stocks for Steve's family by using VBA. 

## Overview of Project:
  The purpose of this project is that to extract and analyze the data of stocks in 2017 and 2018 through VBA. The results can us to understand the implementation and expected development of stocks. Help Steve's parents know how to make the right investments.
The original VBA macro was only for the target processing data of 12 stocks. For efficient analysis of more data, it is necessary to refactor.

## Results:
  By refactoring the code, it can be seen that the execution time has decreased from 0.7 and 0.8 seconds to 0.2 and 0.3 seconds. In the original macro, the code repeatedly read the data to analyze and output it as instructed. In the improved program, because of the index used, only one side of the data needs to be read, and then different analyses and outputs are performed, so the running time is saved. The new macro is good for running more stocks, such as hundreds or thousands.

## Summary
1. Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code in general

In many cases, the original things are generally more "tight fit", and there will be some imperfections when changes are made. Improvements make things more progressive and efficient, though. Technology and society are constantly improving in refactoring.


2. Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

*Advantages of refactored:*
Because the index is used to limit the range of the ticker, it is only necessary to read the sticker of the stock once each time to confirm the area for analysis. So this macro runs fast and can analyze large data.

*Disadvantages of refactored:*
This group of refactored Codes requires high memory, because the repeated use of i is easy to confuse, and it is not easy for others to read.

*Advantages of original:*
This macro is relatively simple, clear in structure, and easy to understand and read when using it.

*Disadvantages of original:*
Because the background operation of the loop is complicated and slow, it is not suitable for large amounts of data.
